# WF Fissure Price

This project is based on
[wfinfo-ng](https://github.com/knoellle/wfinfo-ng)
since it has not been updated in over a year, 
decided to make a new project instead of a fork and 
just copy code when needed

I want this project to work more like
[WFinfo](https://github.com/WFCD/WFinfo)
(mainly just the overlay stuff)
